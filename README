BUILDING

 Run "./autogen.sh" to generate the configure scripts if
nessesary. The man page "doc/rtorrent.1" must be generated with
"docbook2man rtorrent.1.xml" if it is missing.

 Note that rtorrent follows the development of libtorrent closely, and
thus the versions must be in sync. This should not be nessesary in the
future, when the library API stabilizes.

USAGE

 See the man page or website for instructions.

LICENSE

 GNU GPL, see COPYING. "libtorrent/src/utils/sha_fast.{cc,h}" is
originally from the Mozilla NSS and is under a triple license; MPL,
LGPL and GPL. An exception to non-NSS code has been added for linking
to OpenSSL as requested by Debian, though the author considers that
library to be part of the Operative System and thus linking is allowed
according to the GPL.

 Use whatever fits your purpose, the code required to compile with
Mozilla's NSS implementation of SHA1 has been retained and can be
compiled if the user wishes to avoid using OpenSSL.

DEPENDENCIES

  libcurl >= 7.12.0
  ncurses
